My name is Michelle Milker, I am 21 years old and study media informatics at the TU and FU Berlin.

As part of my bachelor thesis I have refined 3d-on-3d on *annotate.photo*.
Now I want to test the changes on users to be able to evaluate the changes and improvements.

If you have any questions regarding the test, please feel free to contact me via email.
