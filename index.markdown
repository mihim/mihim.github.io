## Welcome to the user study

On this page you will find all relevant information and links.

The questionnaire will guide you through the whole process.
It will give you an introduction, ask for your opinion and show you the tasks that have to be completed.
If you want to stop the trial, you can do so at any time without giving any reasons.

Please open the link and follow the instructions:

## What can you expect?

You will solve small tasks with the help of a 3D tool, called [annotate.photo](http://annotate.photo/){:target="_blank"}, that do not take long.
The tasks consist of identifying objects in a scene and labeling them. You will learn how to do this in the test through different ways.

The whole test does not exceed the duration of one hour.

## Preparation

Before you start the experiment, we ask you to download some point clouds [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e2Svnzeb38rXFrsM0XdQVqG0CwKrxDRw?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.
These point clouds will contain the scenes where the objects that need to be classified are located.
This may take some time and memory as they can be up to 100MB in size.
The files ending with '_2' are smaller files of the normal ones.  

## After the test

When you have finished all tasks, save the labeled point clouds as a **JSON** file by pressing **Ctrl + S**.
As filename, please enter your user test code that you have been assigned. It looks like this, for example: *xy_00*.
Please upload them under [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b-v4cJIoSojXPliPwbi8spnuRoTbS_la?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}
